# diabetes-linear-regression

In this project, the goal was to use a linear regression model to predict how a specific feature, such as "bmi" (body mass index), relates to the progression of diabetes in individuals. The project involved several key steps, from data loading and preparation to model training, prediction, measurement, and visualization. The "diabetes" dataset from sklearn is used for this exploration.
